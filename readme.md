## Introduction

Value investing is an investment strategy that involves identifying undervalued stocks and investing in them for long-term growth. This project implements a machine learning model that utilizes financial data to identify undervalued stocks and make predictions on their potential future performance.

The model is trained using historical financial data, and it leverages various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. The trained model can then be used to make predictions on new data, including identifying undervalued stocks and suggesting potential investment opportunities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/value-investing-ml-model.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Replace `your_dataset.csv` with your own dataset in CSV format.
   - Ensure that the dataset contains the necessary columns, including features and the target variable.

2. Train the model:
   - Run the `train_model.py` script to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

3. Backtesting:
   - Prepare a separate backtest dataset using historical financial data.
   - Run the `backtest_model.py` script to evaluate the model's performance on the backtest dataset.

4. API Deployment:
   - Customize the Flask app according to your specific requirements.
   - Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
   - Use the `/predict` endpoint to make predictions on new data by sending a POST request.

## API Documentation

The API exposes the following endpoint:

- `/predict`: POST endpoint to make predictions on new data.

The expected input format for the `/predict` endpoint is JSON, and the response is also in JSON format.

Example request:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "feature1": 123,
      "feature2": 456
    },
    {
      "feature1": 789,
      "feature2": 321
    }
  ]
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "predictions": [1.23, 4.56]
}
```
